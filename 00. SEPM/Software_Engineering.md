## What is Software Engineering?

- The Term Software Engineering is the product of two words
  - `Software` : The software is a collection of integrated programs. Software subsists of carefully-organized instructions and code written by developers on any of various particular computer languages.
  - `Engineering` : Engineering is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain, and improve frameworks, processes, etc.
- `Software Engineering` : is an engineering branch related to the evolution of software product using well-defined scientific principles, techniques, and procedures. The result of software engineering is an effective and reliable software product.

### Why Software Engineering?

- To manage Large software
- For more Scalability
- Cost Management
- To manage the dynamic nature of software
- For better quality Management

### Characteristics of a good software engineer

- Exposure to systematic methods, i.e., familiarity with software engineering principles.
- Good technical knowledge of the project range (Domain knowledge).
- Good programming abilities.
- Good communication skills. These skills comprise of oral, written, and interpersonal skills.
- High motivation.

## Software Process

- `Software`: The term software specifies to the set of computer programs, procedures and associated documents (Flowcharts, manuals, etc.) that describe the program and how they are to be used.

- `Software Process` : is the set of activities and associated outcome that produce a software product. Software engineers mostly carry out these activities.

- These are four key process activities, which are common to all software processes.
  - `Software specifications`: The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.
  - `Software development`: The software to meet the requirement must be produced.
  - `Software validation`: The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.
  - `Software evolution`: The software must evolve to meet changing client needs.

### Software Process Model

- A `software process model` is a specified definition of a software process, which is presented from a particular perspective.
- `Models`, by their nature, are a simplification,
- so a `software process` model is an abstraction of the actual process, which is being described.
- `Process models` may contain activities, which are part of the software process, software product, and the roles of people involved in software engineering
-

### Program Vs Software

- Software is more than programs.
- Any program is a subset of software, and it becomes software only if documentation & operating procedures manuals are prepared.
- Three components of a software:

<br>

1. `Program`: Program is a combination of source code & object code.
2. `Documentation`: Documentation consists of different types of manuals. Examples of documentation manuals are: Data Flow Diagram, Flow Charts, ER diagrams, etc.

<br>

3. `Operating Procedures`: Operating Procedures consist of instructions to set up and use the software system and instructions on how react to the system failure. Example of operating system procedures manuals is: installation guide, Beginner's guide, reference guide, system administration guide, etc.

## Software development life cycle (SDLC)

- Software development life cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software. SDLC, or software development life cycle, is a methodology that defines the entire procedure of software development step-by-step.

<br>


### SDLC Models
- Software Development life cycle (SDLC) is a spiritual model used in project management that defines the stages include in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study to the maintenance of the completed application.

- There are different software development life cycle models specify and design, which are followed during the software development phase. 
- These models are also called "Software Development Process Models." 
- Each process model follows a series of phase unique to its type to ensure success in the step of software development.
