# Command Line

### The Shell

- A shell is a type of computer program called a command-line interpreter that lets Linux and Unix users control their operating systems with command-line interfaces
- `Why the name "Shell"`:The Linux command line interface is called a shell because it is an outer layer (like a walnut’s shell) around the operating system’s core functions. Users communicate with the system’s core by typing commands into this outer layer.
- `Importance of Linux Shell`: While modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) provide a user-friendly way to interact with computers, sysadmins and seasoned users still prefer a shell for several reasons
  - Efficiency
  - Scripting And Automation
  - Remote Access
  - Economic Resource Consumption
