# History

- In 1969, **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie** of Bell Laboratories developed the UNIX operating system.
- It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable and eventually became a widely used operating system.
- A decade or so later, Richard Stallman started working on the GNU[^1] (GNU is Not UNIX) project, the GNU kernel called Hurd, which unfortunately never came to completion
- The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk to the software.
- During this time other efforts such as BSD, MINIX, etc were developed to be UNIX like-systems. However, one thing that all these UNIX like-systems had in common was the lack of a unified kernel.
- Then in 1991, a young fellow named **Linus Torvalds** started developing what we now know today as the Linux kernel.

```
- The term Linux is actually quite a misnomer, 
- Since it actually refers to the Linux kernel. 
- Many distributions use the Linux kernel so therefore are commonly known as Linux operating systems.

```

- A linux system is divided into 3 parts:
  - `Hardware`: Includes all the H/Ws like Memory CPU, Disks
  - `Linux Kernel`: Core of the operating System 
  - `User Space`: Beautiful View of the operating system, THE GUI
