# Working With Git Branch
- In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
- Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.
- When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.
- You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.
- Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!

## Create a New Branch
```bash
Prita@hacker404 MINGW64 /d/DevOps/05. GIT (Git/Intro-To-Branch)
$ git branch
  Git/Git-and-GitHub
* Git/Intro-To-Branch
  Intro-To-Branch/Branch-Merge
  main
```
*mark indicated the current working branch

- checkout is the command used to check out a branch. Moving us from the current branch, to the one specified at the end of the command:
```bash
Prita@hacker404 MINGW64 /d/DevOps/05. GIT (Git/Intro-To-Branch)
$ git checkout hello-world-images
Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'
```
```
Note: Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist
```
